## Exercise Description

### Instructions
This exercise is meant to test your technical skills and level of Python familiarity.

Please complete the task below.

This exercise should take no more than 1 hour.


### Task
In accordance with our brand styleguide, we need to convert all instances of whole numerals between 1 and 99 with the written form of the numbers in our copy.

Write a function in Python that accepts a string of text and returns the string with its numerals replaced.

For example, "The 2 little men bought 3 fish."  would be transformed to "The two little men bought three fish."

If the number is the beginning of a sentence, it should be properly capitalized.


## To Do
With more time I'd like to:

- Address TODO comments in the code.  Most are clean up items.
- Add more tests including tests for bad values.
